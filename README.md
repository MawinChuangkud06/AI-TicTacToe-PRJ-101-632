# **AI TicTacToe PRJ-101 #632**  
An AI TicTacToe game Project using the **MiniMax Algorithm** with difficulty levels: **Easy, Medium, Hard**.  

## **Description**  
This project is a TicTacToe game where players can compete against an AI opponent powered by the **MiniMax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
if you interested in this Project or Wanted to Make One Yourself This Project is Pretty Begineer Friendly
This Project Doesnt use Node For The Algorithm As Primary Thing For The Algorithm
Since the Code Without Node is Working Fine So it doesnt matter to Add it
the AI Without Depth Can Bascially Does the Same Thing as With Depth Does and Also Simpler Than The Depth One
but i reccommend the one with Depth it look Smarter than AI without Depth
